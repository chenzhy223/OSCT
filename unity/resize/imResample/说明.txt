Unzip code or clone it from https://github.com/chaoma99/lct-tracker.git

Add the vl_feat toolbox in your current path http://www.vlfeat.org/

If you don't have the object tracking benchmark (OTB) dataset yet, run 'download_videos.m' (it will automatically download the OTB-100 sequences)

Run utility/compile.m to comile calcIIF.cpp and im2colstep.c. These files are tested with opencv3.0. Notice the compatibility issue if your opencv version is earlier than 3.0

The source files "assignToBins1.c", "gradientMex.cpp", 'imResample.cpp' are from Pitor Dollar's toolbox. If the compiled files do not work on your system, get it from http://vision.ucsd.edu/~pdollar/toolbox/doc/index.html
